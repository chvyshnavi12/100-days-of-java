Excellent goal 👏 — A **100-day structured plan** is one of the best ways to go from **Java beginner → advanced developer**, especially if you want to build strong problem-solving and project skills.

Below is a **complete 100-day roadmap** with *daily question themes*, grouped by topics.
I’ll include **specific coding questions**, **concepts to learn**, and **mini-project ideas** — so by Day 100, you’ll be solid in Core Java, OOP, DSA, and Full Stack Java skills.
